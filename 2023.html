    <h2 id="text" style="text-align: center;">Interviews and insights</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">This song went viral on TikTok as the epitome of female rage and the centuries of its suppression that women have had to deal with while juggling
        all the expectations that they deal with from a young age. There was such a wide reach and connection to the song and its meaning, that Paloma released a second version titled "LABOUR (the cacophony)"
        that features a variety of her fans' voices in the chorus, women screaming that they do too much labor, with videos submitted by fans lipsyncing and showing
        their rage as the music video.

        <b>Women are just doing more and more, and men are not doing any more than they've ever done. There's still expectation for women to have this very traditional archaic role as a
            caregiver and a servant and a wife and a mother and a homemaker, but women have had enough of existing to serve other people (Breese)</b></q>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;" id="text"> Political context</h2>
    <h3><b>After Trump Administration</b></h3>
    <p style="text-align: left">Trump becoming President led to large increase in hate crimes and hate speech, with white supremacists increasing their public activity, like the Proud Boys, because of an
    overall lack of accountability taken by the federal government. The end of his first term, 2021, was a key moment when rioters
    attacked the United States Capitol on January 6th due to Trump's false claims of election fraud that ended in him losing the presidential election against Joe Biden.</p>
    <h3><b>Overturnall of Roe v. Wade</b></h3>
    <p style="text-align:left">The song came out a year after the overturall in 2022, leading to many states severely banning abortion, and even criminalizing
    miscarriages, and doctors being unable to treat women with health problems until the problem is "severe" enough for the abortion to be considered necessary by the state.</p>
    <h3><b>Fourth Wave Feminism</b></h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">This wave's main focus is on intersectionality, positionality, and the overall different rights of social groups. There's a focus on 
        power, who has it and the overall power imbalance in society, as well as reproductive justice and racial justice. There is more discussion 
        on transgender rights, disability rights, and LGBTQ+ rights as a whole.

        In the 2020s, the main focus shifted to abortion rights, racial justice in the form of defunding the police after George Floyd's
        death by the police, and queer rights as many bills have been introduced in state governments that defunds queer and trans healthcare,
        education, participation in sports, and there has been an overall increase of homophobic and transphobic propoganda and discussion that
        will only hurt LGBTQ+ people's right to live their lives, and young queer people's safety in Republican states.
