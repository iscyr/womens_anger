        <p cite="https://americansongwriter.com/the-enlightened-rebelliousness-fueling-the-meaning-of-tori-amos-precious-things/"> Amos grew up in a religious background; the song is her reckoning
            and trying to unlearn the modest beliefs she saw in her mother and grandmother. The song overall touches on her expectations of a worthy partner.

        <h3><b>Bill Clinton becomes President</b></h3>
        <p>The song is released the year when Reagan's presidency changes to George Bush. Additionally, in November 1988 Reagan declares the War on Drugs.</p>
        <h3><b>AIDS Crisis</b></h3>
        <p>The AIDS epidemic began in the early 1980s and continued until the 1990s.</p>
        <h3><b>Cold War</b></h3>
        <p>The Cold War with Russia was ongoing in this period, from the late 1940s and continued on into the 90s.</p>
        <h3><b>Third Wave Feminism</b></h3>
        <p>This wave mainly focused on the sexual enlightenment and revolution of women, and was grounded in the advancements of the second wave.
            A key moment of this period was Anita Hill's televised testimony in 1991 that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her. This wave
            also saw new theories such as intersectionality, transfeminism, and postmodern feminism.
