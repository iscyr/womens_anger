        <p cite="www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=ELos5H2pYXM"> The song is about class divides and the frustration of the poor and disenfranchised in the 1980s.
            Chapman was inspired at the age of 16 by feeling frustrated with people with money not thinking that the poor couldn't make change; when it's ordinary people that rise up for social change 
            that makes all the change happen -- "I feel that's where the changes come from, because that's where people are in most need and most trouble".

        <h3><b>End of the Reagan Era</b></h3>
        <p>The song is released the year when Reagan's presidency changes to George Bush. Additionally, in November 1988 Reagan declares the War on Drugs.</p>
        <h3><b>AIDS Crisis</b></h3>
        <p>The AIDS epidemic began in the early 1980s and continued until the 1990s.</p>
        <h3><b>Cold War</b></h3>
        <p>The Cold War with Russia was ongoing in this period, from the late 1940s and continued on into the 90s.</p>
        <h3><b>1987 Stock Market Crash</b></h3>
        <p>All of these concurring events led to unrest and the frustration of the poor and working class.</p>
        <h3><b>Second Wave Feminism</b></h3>
        <p>This wave of feminism was mainly concerned with workplace disparities, and the idea that women should have the right to be something other than housewives in the home. This wave was only groundbreaking for white middle and uper class women, as working class women of color were already had to work to help their families.</p>
        <p>Overall, there was a push for equality in the public sphere, for equality in education and employment, as well as domestic violence legislation to make violence against women a crime.</p>
