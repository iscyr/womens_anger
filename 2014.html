        <p style="text-align: left;">This song is about the beauty expectations placed on women by society, and fighting back against that by accepting who you truly are. Overall, it's an empowering song for young girls
            to relate to and feel seen.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;" id="text"> Political context</h2>
        <h3><b>Obama Administration</b></h3>
        <p style="text-align: left">President Obama, the first African American to hold office, was president from 2009 to 2017, and overall saw a more progressive shift in society in his two terms.</p>
        <h3><b>Right before Obergefell v. Hodge Supreme Court Case</b></h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">The song came out a year before the historic Supreme Court case that recognized that same-sex marriage was a federal right.</p>
        <h3><b>Fourth Wave Feminism</b></h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This wave's main focus is on intersectionality, positionality, and the overall different rights of social groups. There's a focus on 
            power, who has it and the overall power imbalance in society, as well as reproductive justice and racial justice. There is more discussion 
            on transgender rights, disability rights, and LGBTQ+ rights as a whole.
