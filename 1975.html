        <p cite="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/26/735819094/lesley-gore-you-dont-own-me-american-anthem"> The song is the perspective of a woman who was constantly getting pregnant and being an at home mother, but who is now going to life her lifestyle
            because of "the pill," after Roe v. Wade made abortion a federally constitutional right. However, the song was banned from the radio, until it hit the charts and it was unbanned and was allowed to play. PBS broadcasting
            released a documentary episode titled: "Loretta Lynn: Still a Mountain Girl" that looks into her successful career as a country artist.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;" id="text"> Political context</h2>
        <h3><b>Roe v. Wade</b></h3>
        <p>The song was written and released after the U.S. Supreme court struck down the ban on abortion and held that it was a fundamental right in the legendary case in 1973. However, in 2022, the Court overturned this ruling, stating that there is no federal constitutional right to abortion. This has led to widesweeping bans on abortion in many states, pushing us back in progression.</p>
        <h3><b>Second Wave Feminism</b></h3>
        <p>This wave of feminism was mainly concerned with workplace disparities, and the idea that women should have the right to be something other than housewives in the home. This wave was only groundbreaking for white middle and uper class women, as working class women of color were already had to work to help their families.</p>
        <p>Overall, there was a push for equality in the public sphere, for equality in education and employment, as well as domestic violence legislation to make violence against women a crime.</p>
