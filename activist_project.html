    <h2 id="text">Purpose of this project</h2>
    <h3 id="text">This activist project was created for the Power of Women's Anger class at Roger Williams University.</h3>
    <p>This website will look at songs and themes central to the power of women's anger and how its use in songs has evolved through the waves of feminism up to the present day. This organization, EmpowerUs, was created as a landing page for the project but will function as a way to raise awareness and bring people together to continue the fight for liberation and rights for everyone.</p>
    <p>Six songs from different decades were analyzed, ranging from the 1960s to the 2020s. We will look at the lyrics of the songs and how they fit in the wave of feminism of the decade, and the overall political context when the songs were written or what they were inspired by. Our hope is that you'll be inspired by the songs you'll see today to do your own research, critically look at the songs being released in present day, and how they can fit into the conversation about feminism in all its forms, especially with intersectionality.</p>
