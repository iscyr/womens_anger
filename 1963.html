        <p cite="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/26/735819094/lesley-gore-you-dont-own-me-american-anthem">The song was written by two men, David White and John Madara, despite the song inspiring feminists long after its release in 1963.
            They wanted to write a song about a woman "telling a guy off" which went against traditional songs of the early 1960s with female singers mooning over guys (Ulabey).
            Madara himself was inspired by growing up in a multiracial neighborhood and his own participation in the Civil Rights Movement.
        </p>
        <q cite="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/26/735819094/lesley-gore-you-dont-own-me-american-anthem"><b>All of these things still exist, and that is literally the haunting of 'You Don't Own Me' -- all of the ways in which systems of patriarchy continue to reveal themselves in our everyday lives. (Ulabey)</b></q>
        <p cite="https://americansongwriter.com/behind-the-song-lyrics-lesley-gores-feminist-civil-rights-anthem-you-dont-own-me/">Not only is the song about rejecting the notion of a man "owning" a woman, but it was also about people fighting against rooted systems of inequality (Benetitez-Eves).</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;" id="text"> Political context</h2>
        <h3><b>Civil Rights Movement</b></h3>
        <p>The song was written and released in the height of the social movement to abolish racial segregation and discrimination in America. Additionally, because the song writers were directly inspired by the movement, it is crucial to recognize this and remember when talking about "You Don't Own Me".</p>
        <h3><b>Second Wave Feminism</b></h3>
        <p>This wave of feminism was mainly concerned with workplace disparities, and the idea that women should have the right to be something other than housewives in the home. This wave was only groundbreaking for white middle and uper class women, as working class women of color were already had to work to help their families.</p>
        <p>Overall, there was a push for equality in the public sphere, for equality in education and employment, as well as domestic violence legislation to make violence against women a crime.</p>
        <h3><b>Counterculture Movement</b></h3>
        <p cite="https://www.britannica.com/topic/1960s-counterculture">This song was also in the middle of the Vietnam War, where there was protests against the war in the Counterculture movement itself.
        The movement's members advocatd for peace, revolution, and love, while being an alternative approach to life through activities and lifestyles like recreational drug use, and the folk and rock music that was key for the time period.
        The protests ranged from peaceful to those engaged in armed resistance, by college students protesting the Vietnam War, to those fighting for racial injustice, women's rigthts, LGBTQ+ rights, and later on sexual freedom.
        For example, the Black Panther Party fought to protect Black neighborhoods from police brutality.</p>
